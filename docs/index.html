<h1>Weekly Brief – January 12, 2026</h1>

<h2>Cybersecurity Events &amp; Incidents</h2>
<ul>
<li>North Korea–linked APT Kimsuky (APT43) uses malicious QR code spear‑phishing (“quishing”) against government agencies, think tanks, and academic institutions, bypassing traditional email security filters. <a href="https://securityaffairs.com/186755/intelligence/north-korea-linked-apt-kimsuky-behind-quishing-attacks-fbi-warns.html" target="_blank">Source: https://securityaffairs.com/186755/intelligence/north-korea-linked-apt-kimsuky-behind-quishing-attacks-fbi-warns.html</a></li>
<li>Chinese‑speaking threat actors exploited VMware ESXi zero‑day vulnerabilities to deploy an exploit toolkit that escapes VMs and compromises the hypervisor, suggesting development long before public disclosure. <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2026/01/chinese-linked-hackers-exploit-vmware.html" target="_blank">Source: https://thehackernews.com/2026/01/chinese-linked-hackers-exploit-vmware.html</a></li>
