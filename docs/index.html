</ul>

<h3 style="color:darkblue;"><strong>Analyst Comments / Defender Impact Summary</strong></h3>
<p>Organizations must regard OAuth and other non-human identity tokens as critical attack surfaces. The Gainsight/Salesforce incident underscores that adversaries are shifting to “trusted app” exploits rather than classic perimeter breaches. VPN and firewall login portals remain high-value targets - the brute-force surge against GlobalProtect/EPS endpoints shows attackers probing for exposed access points. Defenders should prioritise token inventory, integration scope reduction, MFA enforcement, login anomaly detection, and applying the latest patches on network access infrastructure.</p>

<h3 style="color:darkblue;"><strong>U.S.-Focused Threat Intelligence Snapshot</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The Salesforce/Gainsight compromise affects U.S.-based SaaS vendor ecosystems and their downstream customer organizations, implying U.S. enterprises are at risk. Revocation of tokens and app removal indicates U.S. orgs must audit their integrations. <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4094506/oauth-token-compromise-hits-salesforce-ecosystem-again-gainsight-impacted.html" target="_blank">Source: https://www.csoonline.com/article/4094506/oauth-token-compromise-hits-salesforce-ecosystem-again-gainsight-impacted.html</a></li>
<li>The GlobalProtect login scanning surge includes U.S. IP-space and targets U.S.-based VPN portals, indicating U.S. organisations should harden remote access. <a href="https://cybersecuritynews.com/palo-alto-vpn-under-attack/" target="_blank">Source: https://cybersecuritynews.com/palo-alto-vpn-under-attack/</a></li>
